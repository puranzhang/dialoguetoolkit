Downloading and installing the toolkit
========================================

The toolkit is currently hosted on sourceforge, but will be moved to github in the first quarter of 2016.


Download the full source code of the project by doing an SVN checkout from the repository which is located at:

https://svn.code.sf.net/p/dietsourcecode/code/ 


In linux you would type something like the following at the command prompt:

*svn  co  https://svn.code.sf.net/p/dietsourcecode/code/*

The toolkit is stored as a netbeans project (http://netbeans.org). You can of course use your own IDE, or run it from the command-line. However, it is easiest to run and script using netbeans. If you use netbeans, it should work "out-of-the-box" - there should be no need to play around with linking libraries and directory paths.
